;; This example shows how to use the H.460.23/24 Feature in GnuGk.
;;
;; H.460.23/24 allows supporting endpoints to stream media
;; directly between eachother whether or not one or both are behind a NAT 
;; device and whether or not they are registered on the same GK. 
;; This is a step beyond H.460.18/.19 NAT method (which requires
;; all media to be proxied by each gatekeeper) so to allow media that 
;; can be routed (based on information from the EP NAT test) directly 
;; between the endpoints to be sent directly.
;;
;;
;; Note: For this INI to work properly
;; 1. GnuGk must be compiled against at least H323plus v.1.21 
:: 2. Both H.460.18/19 and H.460.23/.24 compiled in.
;; 3. A supporting client is used. 
;; 4. A STUN (RFC3489) Server must be set
;;    You can download a open source stun server from
;;       http://sourceforge.net/projects/stun/
;;    Instructions on how to set the server up
