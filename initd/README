This folder contains initd scripts for various distributions to
start GnuGk automatically when the server starts.
Usually the scripts must be renamed to 'gnugk' and places into
the folder /etc/rc.d or /etc/init.d .

If you modify one of these scripts to work with your distribution,
please send them in to jan@willamowius.de or post them on the mailinglist.

OpenSuSE:   use gk.initd.suse12 for 12.x (with SysVInit, not systemd), gk.initd.suse10 for 10.x and gk.initd.suse for 9.x
CentOS:     use gk.initd.centos53 or gk.initd.redhat
