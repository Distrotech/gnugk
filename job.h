/** The base abstract class that represents job objects.
    This class implements the way to execute the job.
    Derived classes implement actual jobs (override Run()).
	Jobs are executed and managed by the internal Job managment system
	consisting of the singleton Agent object and Worker threads
	that accept and execute new Jobs.
	
	Specialized Job examples are:
    Jobs - executes series of Tasks
    RegularJob - executes a Task again and again until stopped
    SimpleClassJob - calls a member function of some class that takes no arguments
    SimpleClassJobA - calls a member function of some class that takes one 
	                  argument of reference type
