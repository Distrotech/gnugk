<sect1>About
<p>
<bf>
<url url="http://www.gnugk.org/" name="The GNU Gatekeeper">
</bf>
is an open-source project that implements a H.323 gatekeeper. A gatekeeper
provides call control services to H.323 endpoints and is an integral part of
most telephony or video conferencing installations that are based on the H.323
standard.

According to the H.323 standard, a gatekeeper shall provide the
following services:
<itemize>
<item>Address Translation
<item>Admissions Control
<item>Bandwidth Control
<item>Zone Management
<item>Call Control Signaling
<item>Call Authorization
<item>Bandwidth Management
<item>Call Management
</itemize>

The GNU Gatekeeper implements all of these functions and a number of additional features.
For the protocol handling and encoding and decoding of the messages, it uses the
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/h323plus" name="H323Plus"> library
(a continuation of the now defunct
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openh323" name="OpenH323 project">).

H.323 is an international standard published by the <url
url="http://www.itu.int/" name="ITU">.  It is a communications standard for
audio, video, and data over the Internet.  See also Paul Jones' <url
url="http://www.packetizer.com/voip/h323/papers/primer/" name="A Primer on
the H.323 Series Standard">.

<sect1>Copyright
<p>
The GNU Gatekeeper is covered by the <htmlurl
url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" name="GNU
General Public License version 2"> (GNU GPL v2).  In addition, we explicitly
grant the right to link this code to the OpenH323/H323Plus and OpenSSL
library.

Some protocols implemented in the GNU Gatekeeper are covered by patents
(especially the firewall / NAT traversal protocols).  To the best of our
knowledge, the GNU Gatekeeper Project has a valid license for all its
releases, but users making derived versions of this code must ensure that
they have a valid license before enabling those features.

Generally speaking, the GNU GPL allows you to copy, distribute, resell or
modify the software, but it requires that all derived works must also be
published under the GNU GPL.  This means that you must publish full source
for all extensions to the gatekeeper and for all programs where you
incorporate code from the GNU Gatekeeper.  See the file COPYING for details.

If that's not what you want, you must interface to the gatekeeper through
the status port and communicate with it via TCP.  This allows you to
integrate basic functionality into the gatekeeper (and provide source for
that) but keep other parts of your application private.

<sect1>Name
<p>
The full name of this project is <em>GNU Gatekeeper</em>, but it may also be
referred to as <em>GnuGk</em>.  The use of "GNU" in the name is to emphasize
that this is free software. Early versions were called the <em>OpenH323 Gatekeeper</em>.
