BMV2 Install procedure
======================

(If you can read this, you have probably installed it already.)

1. Copy the tarball to /var/www and do tar -xf <tarball>
2. Set the owner and permissions as required.
3. Copy all the files in bmv/local/sample to bmv/local
4. Edit all files in bmv/local to personalise your system
5. create/change .htaccess files everywhere, and populate them as appropriate.
6. edit your http.conf to add the new virtual server (make sure BMV2 is not installed in a subdirectory)
7. Stop and start Apache (restart may work for you - not recommended).

If you do not know how to do the above, this is not the product you need!

Upgrade procedure is as above, but omit steps 3 to 6.
